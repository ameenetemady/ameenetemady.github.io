One of the main goals in nutrition research is to determine the healthiness of a given diet, based on the consumer's biological, physiological, and behavioral attributes. For example, it is already determined that the healthiness of a diet depends on the consumer's physical activity and age. A healthy diet for a swimmer can involve 12,000 calories a day when training for the Olympics while a bedridden elderly woman, would need a tenth of that calorie intake. But for subtle attributes such as the consumer's gut microbiome, we have only realized their importance, and don't know how to use them for determining the healthiness of a given diet. This is a flourishing area of research that is producing novel discoveries these days.

I recently used gut microbiome data to determine the effect of a low-FODMAP diet for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [\[1\]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2020.12.041). IBS that impacts about 11% of adults, involves a regular occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and bloating. It is common for IBS patients to follow a low-FODMAP diet for managing their symptoms. A low-FODMAP diet lowers the amount of certain carbohydrates that feed the gut microbiome in the large intestine (i.e. not digested in the small intestine). Therefore the patient's reaction to the diet depends on the type of microbes that live there. To use an analogy, consider a scenario involving an alcohol ban for two types of people, alcoholics, and nondrinkers. For alcoholics, we expect major reactions, and for nondrinkers, we don't expect any reaction.

Following an integrated analysis of the combined data from multiple studies, we argued that: patients whose guts are enriched by microbes with short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and methane metabolism capabilities respond well to a low-FODMAP diet. Other patients, may benefit more from probiotics that contain SCFA-producing bacteria such as *lactobacillus*. Further studies are necessary to confirm this.

Many thanks to my advisor Prof. Ilias Tagkopoulos as well as scientists who enabled this work by sharing their research data including Dr. Dania Schumann, Dr. Holger Cramer, Dr. Jordan Bisanz, Dr. Jørgen Valeur, Dr. Keith McIntosh, Dr. Magnus Simrén, Dr. Michael Schultz, Dr. Robin Spiller, Dr. Ruth Harvie, Dr. Sean Bennet, Dr. Stephen Vanner, and Dr. Tim Sloan.
