A main goal of nutrition research, is to determine the healthiness of a given diet, based on the consumer's biological, physiological, and behavioral attributes. For example, it is already determined that the healthiness of a diet depends on the consumer's physical activity and age. A healthy diet for a swimmer, can involve 12,000 calories a day when training for the olympics while a bedridden eldery woman, would need a tenth of that calorie intake. But for subtle attributes such as the the consumer's gut microbiome, we have only realized their importance, and don't know how use them for determining the healthiness of a given diet. This is a flourishing area of research that is producing novel discoveries these days.

I recently used gut microbime data to determine the effect of a low-FODMAP diet for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [\[1\]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2020.12.041). IBS that impacts about 11% of adults, involves regular occurance of gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea and bloating. It is common for IBS patients to follow a low-FODMAP diet for managing their symptoms. A low-FODMAP diet lowers the amount of carbohydrates that feed the gut microbiome in the large intestine (i.e. not digested in the small intestine). Therefore the patient's reaction to the diet depends on the type of microbes that live there. To use an analogy, consider a scenario involving an alcohol ban for two types of people, alcoholics and nondrinkers. For alcoholics, we expect major reactions, and for nondrinkers, we don't expect any reaction.

Following an integrated analysis on the combined data from multiple studies, we argued that: patients who's gut are enriched by microboes with short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and methane metabolism capabilities respond well to a low-FODMAP diet. Other patients, may benefit more from probiotcs that contain SCFA-producing bacteria such as *lactobacillus*. Futher studies are necessary to confirm this.
