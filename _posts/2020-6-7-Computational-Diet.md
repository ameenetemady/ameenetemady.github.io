Our gut microbiome together with intestinal wall cells, modulate the amount of nutritious products absorbed from food into the blood and made available to our organs (e.g. liver, heart, brain, muscles, etc.). The capabilities of our intestinal wall cells is largely restricted by the genome that we are born with. But our gut microbiome is relatively plastic and can be modulated through food, antibiotics, probiotics and prebiotics. Given the emerging advances in microbiome research (especially due to metagenomics and other meta-omics technologies), it is anticipated that microbiome-based nutrition products and dietary recommendations will play a major role in what, and how we eat in the years to come. The figure above illustrates a vision for the next nutrition revolution discussed in our recent article [\[1\]](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00393). The computational methods such as data analytics and recommendation systems will inform our diet based on the personal gut microbiome and health objectives.
