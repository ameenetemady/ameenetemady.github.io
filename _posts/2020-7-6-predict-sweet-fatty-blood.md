The Low-carb, Low-fat, Keto, Vegetarian, Carnivore, and so [much more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_diets), **which diet** is better for me? and **why?** These questions are on the mind of many, actively debated amongst the experts, with no consensus on the horizon. Personalized nutrition companies strive to address this important need.

[ZOE](https://joinzoe.com/) is a leading personalized nutrition company that relies on the idea that "everybodyâ€™s response to food is unique". Their recent study [\[1\]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-0934-0) shows that blood sweetness and fattiness (i.e. glucose and triglyceride levels) after a meal are (a) highly variable amongst individuals, and (b) predictable given person-specific factors and meal macronutrients. Best predictors of blood sweetness were the meal macronutrients, genetics and lifestyle factors such as sleep and physical activity. The best predictors of blood fattiness however were fasting blood assays. The gut microbiome was also a predictive factor for blood sweetness and fattiness, but to a lesser extent. A prior study [\[2\]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.11.001) related to the [DAYTWO](https://www.daytwo.com/) company, however, emphasized the importance of gut microbiome for predicting blood sweetness after the meal. Although both studies are very interesting, they have considerable methodological differences that beg the need for performing a consistent data analysis on their combined data. It will also be very valuable for consumers to know the extent to which the recommendations from these personalized nutrition companies are consistent with each other and with the general advice from nutritionists.
